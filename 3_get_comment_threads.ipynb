For the past few years I would say I’ve watched about 89% of your videos. And not watching the other videos isn’t anything personal I’m sure I’ve just missed some and others just weren’t my style of video to watch. ANYWAYS enough about me, you. There is nothing wrong with you, your life, your videos, your business, your personality, your love life, zilch. You are a normal person who has just so happen to become an influencer and a business woman. It is hard to balance ALL of that. You are never going to make everyone happy. There is always going to be that person who is going to challenge you. I admire that you use that to make yourself better. Keep that spark and energy. Most of all, keep the honesty. When you said you looked back at your videos and didn’t think your content was your best, I mean maybe they don’t meet YOUR standards but they fit you, they fit your channel, and they’re perfect. Don’t think just because you don’t upload makeup tutorials as frequently as you used to, that’s okay as much as I do like to see your tutorials and make up looks, I truly LOVE to be able to sit down with you chat, or collab, closet tours, brush collections, etc. it doesn’t matter what I’m doing whether I’m cleaning, about to fall asleep, doing my make up, working out, watching your videos never fail to bring some sort of peace. Almost like we’re besties! I don’t think I’d feel like this if it wasn’t for your honesty, work ethic, constantly doing work, and your own thing! It inspires me! I could go on and on but I’m going to finish off with this: over the years I’ve truly come to learn that life is about who you surround yourself with and I truly feel like watching your videos does good things for me! So thank you! If you never read this, it’s okay I just hope that you do and I really hope you continue to your own thing! Xoxo, MariSol!'],\n",

Literally watching this video stresses me out as well because I see it from a business and Jaclyn’s POV. The amount of money spent is ridiculous. Like no matter what, as consumers, you can’t forget about the amount of money being invested. If morphe was a smaller company they would’ve been run to the ground. It completely infuriated me listening to LIES about this product because it RUINS market research, brand image etc and thats fucking important to a brand. I don’t get why people are so worked up about the amount of money Jaclyn earns anyway. Shouldn’t people be happy that she’s earning what she is with the huge amount of effort she puts in? What about football players who earns millions of dollars etc etc? Anyway, I am 100% behind Jaclyn and I think that people need to take a step back and put themselves in her shoes and morphe’s POV. If they are doing all they can on a product, let them do they’re job. If you have concrete proof of a crappy pallets, send it back so that they can do their job right.'],\n",

The only difference in people who make it and those who don’t is they didn’t put everything they had into it!! We ALL have the potential to be successful!

It’s very sickening and dark, when I read the comments, reviews and tweets that people post that are negative... I just want to throw something at them 😂 like WHAT?! This world is scary and it’s disgusting, especially since social media is very negative and people feel obligated to use it as fire towards others. I’m sorry for all the negativity that you are being thrown. People who hate, are people who envy you, because they are not who you are, and do not have the ability to do what you are doing.

Like all these apology videos and talking about the beauty community it's so unnecessary. If someone constantly questioned you and made you feel bad about how you did your job/earned your money, you would lose your mind. Like who cares if people support Morphe or dont? Its just a makeup company. These are just people making videos and trying to make a living. Why are they questioned/judged constantly??? If you dont like someone on youtube, dont watch them. If you dont like a brand/a product, dont buy it. Youtubers could be putting up actual makeup videos instead of unnecessary videos about business and other youtubers. Like get over yourself if you think Jaclyn or anyone else should feel bad about a sponsorship or collab or discount code. I make commission at my sales position and no one makes me feel bad for that. They work hard and deserve it like the rest of us. So done with this I just want to watch makeup tutorials....smh\"],\n",

Suggest positive comments and positive criticism. If jaclyn was only about the money, imagine all the things she would have done to get money... do you people realize how easy it would be for her to take sponsorships and easy way outs for money. But instead she's honest, she doesn't hate on other companies, and she works her booty off for the things she cares about. Its costs money to return her palette to morphe? Contact morphe via email, via phone, and explain the situation because according to other comments they will refund you and let you keep the palette or maybe they'll give you the credit to return it. I think she should move forward after this and continue her older journey of just genuine makeup tutorials too but geez to many haters on here\"],\n",

There are so many things I would say ❤️ but I love you and I hope that your life will be full with things to smile and to be happy about. Thank you  💕'],\n",

If someone wants more money or believes they deserve it, it is their right. They are used to other multimillion dollar companies. Sure MakeupGeek isn't that, but then they need to go for the smaller influencers and make their makeup be well priced and interesting products for the consumer; thus not making them lose money.

So let’s say she does the same this year. A million divided by 12 would be 83,333 palettes that she would ROUGHLY\\n sells EACH month. Now let’s divide that into days. If we were dividing that by 30.5 (some months have 31, some months have 31) then the average per day give or take would be 2,732. Jaclyn’s Palette hit August 14th. Now it’s been out for ROUGHLY 3 WEEKS. 2,732 x 21 days= 57,377. One percent of that is 573 palettes being sent back, and it’s only been out for 3 weeks. Again this is nottttt including the people who switched there’s out for a new palette. Again this is my opinion, I just find it hard that if she was right only around 10,000 palettes were sold, especially for a launch.'],\n",

I abso-freakin'-lutely LOVE the original palette that came out and can't wait to try the vault's. I always thought people who like to stir the pot should get to lick the spoon. And people who aren't being honest always get figured out. And honestly if they were in that position they'd probably be defensive too, but you still owned up to the fact that the product was having issues and are trying to fix it, and not to mention YOU are not the ONLY person involved in the process of creating the product (like I said, I'm not involved or fully know how the creation process of makeup takes place). I wouldn't take it too hard personally because I think you're doing a fantastic job and can't wait to see more of your products in the future. And of course we want to see you use some other products in your videos but some of your greatest accomplishments happened with Morphe and I thinks it's awesome to take pride in that and to be grateful to a company that's meant so much to you. <3\"],\n",

That 1st child reads the sentence to themself, then whispers the sentence into the ear of the next child.  The 2nd child whispers what they heard the 1st person say into the ear of the 3rd child. That passing of the original sentence goes on down the line until you get to the very last child. The last child then says out loud what was whispered to them. This game has been called by many names.  It was called the Telephone Game when I was teaching way back in the late 1980s. The sentence that was given to the 1st child will be nothing like the final sentence said out loud by the last child.  The point of the game is that gossip is a bad thing,  and that one little bit of information whispered into that 1st ear ends up being something completely different, and nothing even close to what the 1st person said by the time it is said out loud by that last person!\\n\\nDrama channels should be for entertainment purposes only! Take anything said on a drama channel with a grain of salt. \\n\\nSwatching an eyeshadow on your arm is never going to give you the same results as when you use them on your eye lids! Many people swatch with their fingertips. When you do that,  shimmers and glitter shadows are going to look better than matte shadows. That is why we often apply those types of shadows with our finger. Fingers have oil on them, brushes do not. Most people prep their eye lids before they apply shadow, but normally don't prep their arm before they swatch! There are many reasons why a shadow may not swatch well. Try using the eyeshadow the way it was intended to be used before making a decision on the quality of the product!!\\n\\nJust saying!!!\"],\n",

If you don’t like her don’t watch/follow her, don’t buy her products simple as that. But stop bashing on people for doing their fucking jobs, I’m pretty sure no one does that to you about your job and if they did you’d all throw a fit. Not to mention probably 90% of you wouldn’t have the balls to put your life out online for everyone to see and criticize CONSTANTLY. Jesus christ get a fucking life and worry about yourself. Stop living such a negative, miserable life. It’s make up for fucks sake it’s not that serious. I guarantee everyone hating is just bitter and jealous because they have shit jobs, shit lives, no one likes them, and they can’t afford a nice house or nice things. Get over it. Life isn’t all about materialistic bull shit or followers or likes. I’ll never understand why you get so much hate when there are other influencers that are just straight up awful people who only care about money and yet I don’t see them getting half as much hate as you do.

I think it’s amazing what she’s done and the life she’s made for herself. It dumbfounds me that people get on here and comment on beauty influencers videos like they know them and know what they go through with their businesses and what they go through in their personal life. How people actually make the time to say hateful things and comment on her wealth like that’s any of their business. There’s no telling how stressful having your own brand can be and how much work that takes. Just because she isn’t on YouTube everyday doesn’t mean she isn’t working. Jaclyn, keep doing you honey! No one has room to judge or talk about your life like they actually know anything. Putting yourself out there and being vulnerable only shows how genuine you are. I respect you even more and will continue to look forward to your products and videos. 🤗'],\n",

Sadly babe, but it seems this has only been a big bust and I hate to see that happen to you. Having to make a video explaining yourself should not be a priority, it doesn't seem that many people even appreciated it anyways. Oh well, maybe now we can all move on and go back to makeup!

If you are a different person, then so be it, people grow all the time and it’s a way of life. Understanding and accepting this comes with maturity and it’s no secret a lot of your audience leans towards the younger end of the spectrum. As a friend, I support your success and I am happy for you. But you disappeared, you hid from the world. Understandably, of course. But unfortunately, this is the negative consequence of that. It’s such a tricky line because you don’t owe anyone an explanation for your life or your choices. But as a part of your audience, all I can really say is that I’ve miss you. There was a portion of this video where I felt like you were back and it felt SO good. This is just my perspective and I’m sure there are louder and angrier people out there, so I hope my voice is heard among them 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️'],\n",

First world problems people! Stop going on social media and trolling about first world problems and get some perspective in your life. \\n\\nSecond, I am a Lean Consultant. Lean comes from the Toyota Production System, look it up. I have a job because inconsistencies or \"waste\" is universal and happens in all production or service based businesses. I happen to work in healthcare. There are 7 types of \"waste\" according to Toyota and these wastes are universal. Waiting and defects are the major types of waste. Defects happen in every line of business, regardless who is collaborating on them. The reason for lean is to continuously improve by looking at your processes and removing the waste. Toyota is an $11 billion dollar company and still has defects. Morphe may need to get further along in their journey to improve. \\n\\nThink about other perspectives people!'],\n",
