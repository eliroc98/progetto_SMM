It's why many people with hormone problems see GPs, internists, and DOs for their treatment as endos don't seem to help nor care. Also, since you mentioned salivary testing, I imagine you were tested for low/high cortisol. This is something endos don't get at all. I would suggest you try a DO for your issues.

SO we stopped trying. My condition got better with the other problem, no signs of worse so we decided to stop my medication. I was off for almost 2 years and we started to try to have a baby, 2 years almost, but no baby, so I gave up. We stopped trying, after few months we decided to risk and I go on hormones....2 weeks before my gyno appointment I found out I was pregnant! Now I have a little man who is 6, best boy ever!

My doctor at the time told me just to take pain killers before and during my period. \\nWhen I was 18, I started seeing a new GP who said the same thing. I've now had overwhelmingly painful and heavy periods for 5 years and I feel like that's just how it is for me.\\nAt 19, I started seeing my gyno, who thought I could have endometriosis but wasn't going to diagnose it until she had more information. I tried 3 different birth controls to help with the pain and heaviness and had multiple ultrasounds (internal and external).\\nTwo months ago, I was in urgent care because I couldn't breathe through the pain. I decided to see a new gyno since, after 2 years, she wasn't doing anything other than throwing birth control at me (mind you, I'm engaged to a woman so I'm only on birth control for my pain. I currently have and IUD and have pain during ovulation and during menstruation. \\nThe new gyno ran one test (an ultrasound where she filled my uterus, tubes, and ovaries while saline) and found small cysts covering my ovaries and multiple polyps. She diagnosed me with PCOS and polyps and suggested surgery and switching my birth control. 8 years, 3 doctors, and all it took was one test for me to have answers. \\nDoctors are the worst about gynecological heath. The more you talk about it, the less alone people like me feel. So, I'm sorry that doctor was awful but I really appreciate you talking about it and I appreciate every time you talk about PCOS.\\n<3\"],\n",

What they do is rule out everything else and when all those tests come back negative what your left with is fibro. I had an amazing doctor. She was really great. She left to move to a different practice and I was put with a guy who graduated 4 weeks earlier. When I went in, he told me he wasn't going to bother with any of the remaining tests because I dealt with mild depression when I was a teen-- over 20 years ago, mind you-- and since I'd has some mild seasonal depression as a teen, all the pain I've been in is depression. Then, he told me he was calling in a pill that I was NOT ok with taking as I've taken it when I was young and it messed me up. So, I told him I wasn't comfortable with that and his response was to fill the script, take it or don't take it and come back in 3 months. Mind you it took me 6 months to even get this appt and an insane amount of courage and anxiety. He was super condescendingnot to mention very recently out of school and you not a whole lot about me.I was supposed to go back for an appointment today as today was the three-month revisiting appt and I cancelled it... I told the doctor's office that I did not want to see that doctor anymore as he was not a good fit for me. So now I have to wait another month to get in with another doctor. However I did advocate for myself. I'm glad to hear you did too! Keep going until you find a good fit. \\nThis is so frustrating because I was tempted to just not return to the office. If I wasn't feeling so shitty, I wouldn't. And THATS an issue. I wonder how many people are just avoiding the doctor for reasons such as this??\"],\n",

Like the Dr didn’t listen o me and did invasive shit that was unneeded like breaking my water after one hour of being in the hospital (even though I’d dilated a ton and was doing great) & giving me drug that makes you contract harder. (Both things I did not need and had said I didn’t want.) So my baby can’t turn properly bc the amnionic fluid is gone so I’m in back labor. And she gets stuck and I get stuck in transition.  You could see her head but she wasn’t coming out. So she was stuck in my vaginal channel for awhile before the cut me open to get her out. She was so low that when they cut along the top of my pubes they also cut her lower right cheek. So there’s this wall between you rectum and vagina, it’s all fcked now. Like it doesn’t have strength anymore. And I swear my vagina now has some twists and turns that were def not there before. I can’t use tampons without an applicator anymore and even cardboard applicators are tough to use bc I have to I’m it in there at a f king angle and can’t then push it out. So I pay a premium for eco friendly plastic applicators. But a cup is tricker to use then tampons and I sometimes have to go through a few tampons just to get one in. I’m trying to talk my kid into the cup but she’s strictly a pad girl. It’s all such a pain. Also when period came back when my baby was almost two (one of the benefits of breastfeeding exclusively) it cane back with the PMS from hell. My first period after having my baby I had a panic attack so bad (I didn’t know it was pms or that I was starting my period) that my mom had to give me a benzo. It was nuts. Fortunately that’s not a thing anymore bc I’m scared of benzos.'],\n",

I have a lot of symptoms of PCOS, but my gyno said I have to get off BC to get more testing done... but the amount of pain and agony that\\'s going to cause me, is a big hell-nope from me. I would love to hear what you have to say and your personal experience with it.  \\nI\\'m sorry that you had an awful experience with a doctor. I fully understand the amount of time, money, and struggle that goes into a medical degree.. but LORD do some people need to come back down to earth for 2 seconds and take a deep breath and either care for their patients with a passion, or find a new career.  I have been so lucky to find a good doctor who listens once moving back home.. I ended up having a chest infection and bronchitis due to my work environment, and had a doctor tell me \"yeah, you have all this. I\\'m NOT going to treat you\" so I avoided doctors completely up until recently because it gives me an ungodly amount of anxiety. I hope karma comes for that doctor\\'s whole ass. And I hope you are able to find a far better doctor who actually knows how to do their job.

I hate feeling the way ur describing, and ur right, all it takes is one thing to send u down a spiral.

Luckily, I haven’t gotten quite as low recently as I’ve been in the past, but I still feel like for the average person, I get pretty depressed pretty quickly (once I’m triggered). If I’m not triggered, I feel great, healthy, etc, but when I get the inkling of insecurity, I feel like it hits much harder than for someone who hasn’t been really, really low before.

He literally said: I HAVEN’T STUDIED MEDICINE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS STUPID AS YOURS. \\nMy mom was there and she was speechless. I was so shy back then I didn’t say anything. And we literally went through with surgery. Dumbest decision ever. Cause he apparently wasn’t just not a doctor to answer questions but also not to do surgery well. He removed cartilage from the nose tip that I could move that tip horizontally without pain and the whole tip started drooping like a trunk. That became apparent after 2 years only though. And when I was fresh out of surgery and he was supposed to take out the tampon thingies he did it with such strength that the blood left my head out of pain and rendered me blind for 2 min. Scariest 2 min of my life. His response: THE NEXT PATIENT IS WAITING, YOU GOTTA GET OFF THE CHAIR AND OUT OF MY ROOM NOW! \\noh and the nose? I needed reconstructive surgery and the tissue has been thinned out so much that on my septum I’ve had nose bleeds for 10yrs now and there is nothing to do about it. The revision doc also said that he found a bone that was horizontal in the back of my skull form the nose that he needed to remove through my mouth. So the initial doc basically butchered me.'],\n",

I just figured they were having a bad day and “killed them with kindness.” MOST of the time (99%) they would walk away feeling like a piece of shit or just say sorry. I was nothing but polite, kind, etc. I walked away with a big ass smile on my face (“Next!” Lol), because I didn’t give a sh** either way, I knew I was a good person, and had done nothing wrong. I’m also a confrontational person though, so when people confront me, I don’t shut down. I can see how more introverted/non-confrontational ppl would shut down or internalize it though, and I always saw this happen with my other co-workers. Idk, I just treated the customer as if they were me having a bad day and (while I’d hope I wouldn’t do this) lashing out at others. Also, if they were mad at the company, and took it out on me, I also didn’t give a shit (hell, I’m getting paid shit, I’m on ur side! Yell all u want! Lol! Yell louder! This place sucks! Haha). Again, never took it personal. I think it’s WAYYYY different with YouTube though. YOU are the brand, and when ppl complain, they complain about YOU. It’s hard not to take that personal. Peeps who do YouTube are awesome and have so much strength, I literally cannot imagine. As for the doctor though, he sucks. That was a safe space, and he didn’t respect that or respect you. Such an ahole'],\n",

My doc said it shouldn’t be hurting you so we’re not going to do surgery or anything for that matter. Fast forward 10 years of pain later. Different doc said it’s now the size of a grapefruit. I don’t want you to be in pain so lets operate. Went in for out-patient surgery & woke up admitted in a room with 14 staples. Turns out I had not only a cyst but also had endometriosis everywhere. My doc said he didn’t know how I was living this way for so long. I’ve had several cysts removed over the years and a tubal pregnancy that ruptured. I am now no longer able to have children unless I go through IVF. My husband & I decided that we are not going to try to have any children. We have a granddaughter who’s almost 3(my husband is older & had children from previous marriages) & she is my world. I have honestly been thinking of having a full hysterectomy bc the PMS & Post PMS cramps are so bad that I’m just over it. I have maybe 1 good week out of the month.

When i was 16 I was at a gyno to get help with my horrible pains, and she folded her arms and said to me \"well what do you want me to do about that? Just take more pain killers.\" I left in tears because the pain was so bad and I felt like she just palmed me off as a dramatic teen. \\nLater on after a few surgeries, I was getting an internal ultra sound before another op, and the woman who takes the scans - not even the qualified radiologist -- told me I was probably infertile and should look into IVF if i ever want to have a child. She even spoke to me about freezing my eggs while the scanning device was inside me! I was 20 and it was horrible. I spent a week in a spiral until i could speak with my surgeon about it (which he assured me what she said was total crap), but in that week i felt the exact same way you have described. It was horrible and I was so mad. It made me think 10 years into the future when I really didn\\'t need to be, and I felt like my desire to have kids was just pointless. I hope you know that you\\'re not alone and anyone with any form of chronic pain completely understands.

Everyone want and needs to be heard when they are expressing their medical concerns. I understand that some doctors don't believe in certain conditions.

They work on auto pilot and never truly hear anyone. It's hard to find the right doctor. It really messes up your mentality terribly when you reach out to a Doctor for help . Because you need help and they literally don't give a single crap. You go home and try to figure out how to treat yourself. It leads many people to self medication.  That leads to addictions.  Then they judge you for that. It's a losing situation and Doctors have got to try to do better. It's ridiculous really. I always say this. With any job in this world, if you hate what you are doing, stop doing it especially if you work for the public. There is no sense in spreading your negativity and causing harm to others. Find something else to do if you hate working for the public. That's my motto on that. Anyway, I totally feel you girl. Hang in there.\"],\n",

There is no in between in her mind and caring about my reproductive health outside of that was weird (even though I still have all those parts even if I'm not completely and utterly focused on what they can do for me).

Did a TSH which came back normal, no big deal.

He also asked if I\\'d ever been diagnosed with ADHD and even though I said no, he wanted to give me medication for that with no further testing.

I haven\\'t gone back to him since.

I went to urgent care, they told me they didn’t have the equipment to do an ultrasound so I had to wait two weeks to see my OB. I sat in his waiting room for an hour for him to see me for 5 minutes and prescribe me birth control. For the third time. No ultrasound to make sure it’s not a cyst. No alarm. No concern. \\n\\nNow I’ve been on birth control before and when I tell you it made me sicker than a dog, I mean I was sick for 9 months straight and had a period EVERY day of that 9 months. After telling my dr that, he STILL prescribed me pills. To tell you I felt undervalued at that moment is an understatement. \\n\\n6 months later, I’m still in pain, I owe both urgent care and my OB over $500 for them to diagnose me with dismenorrea. Which is a clinical term for “menstrual cramps”\\n\\nJust like any other area of medicine, whether we have a “cure” for it or not, it’s all about money and they’ll push out prescriptions like candy.

Before I knew what the issue was, I went to see my old doctor (who pressured me into an IUD in the first place) multiple times, as well as the hospital multiple times. I was in so much pain I couldn\\'t walk, sleep, or swallow. The ER doctor refused to help me because \"positive thinking can be as effective as opiates.\" Then she walked out and I had to go home. First of all, I didn\\'t ask for opiates. Secondly, you\\'re here to help me, and part of that would entail actually speaking to me like a human. The amount of pain I was in, once it was figured out/recognized at all was going on, was the equivalent of being in labor. I had that level of pain for 10 months and no one would even humor me because my illness was invisible. My husband I had come to the conclusion on our own, but were told that we were wrong. So, I sat in my doctor\\'s office for 9 hours until she agreed to remove the IUD. I\\'ll never get my mobility back fully and I\\'m terrified of doctors now.

My story is a little different because I've never tried to get pregnant but I can understand how it can feel like such a devastating thing to not be able to have children, especially when doctors are telling you you're not trying hard enough or you don't care enough about your health. It took me so long to get diagnosed with PCOS because many of my doctors didn't know what it was or didn't really seem to care? I was diagnosed when I was 18 or 19 ( I'm now almost 24 ) and then I didn't really do anything about it until I became anemic from having my period so long, got put on birth control, and then had the worst three months of my life as my body tried to cope with the changes to my hormones. I ended up going to the hospital because the cramps and bleeding was so bad I thought something was wrong and I was like dying or something, lol. Long story short, it's been a rough journey for me and I know that doctors, especially male doctors toward women are unsympathetic and generally just assholes. Just know that you are no less of a woman and no less of a person for not being able to have children and because you have PCOS. Thank you for sharing! I'd love to hear your whole experience with PCOS and how you've handled it throughout the years. 💘\"],\n",

I thought if I tell people that, if I tell my friends that and I am not lying-I’m telling them how I actually feel, why would I not believe them whenever they said that to me? And that’s just how I live now. I believe that I am loved, I believe that I bring joy to people’s lives who I care about, and I believe that what I have to give to the world is worth something.  AND I decided who I was going to get my love from, and that circle is small. I GIVE love freely, but I KNOW who I get love from. From my husband, from my kids, from my close close circle of friends. AND THATS IT. So if some person who isn’t one of those people doesn’t give me love, I don’t care. I know where I get my love from. 💕✨ you’re a babe, Kristi.'],\n",

I was 19 for reference. She left the room and went across the hallway into the break room which was right across from mine and did not close the door. When she walked in, she said “welp there’s another girl that will never have kids” and another nurse who clearly didn’t want more kids said “why can’t I have that problem?” And they all laughed.

Pushing it from your mind and trying not to think about it so you can get thru your day to day life isn't the same thing....but that's okay. Like you said it's a life changing thing when the only thing you ever wanted was to be a mother. I know you said the only thing you haven't tried is IVF and I can't imagine trying to go through all that and the money and then sometimes it doesn't even work I mean seriously can't even imagine. But for me personally....I don't know if I would be happy if I didn't try everything. I know I would be 45 or 50 going why didn't I try everything why didn't I go for it. Plus if it does work it would make every single painful moment every shot, every dollar 1 million percent worth it. There was a time I wasn't sure if I could have kids and that was the one thing I knew about my life was I wanted to be a mother so I have had that fear. But I do have children now so take my opinion with a grain of salt or nothing cuz it doesn't matter but I hope you eventually do try again\"],\n",

She gave me the rudest look when she walked in, and when I told her my problem, she looked at me from across the room (I was wearing long sleeves and long pants so most of my body was covered) and goes “I don’t see any rash.” When I showed her, she went “it’s not that bad” (it was, and it was getting worse). I was already feeling anxious bc the medication I was on can cause a severe rash that can be fatal, but she just shut down any concerns I had. When she asked why I had been taking the med and I told her for depression, she was like “are you sure it’s not bipolar or schizophrenia?” as if she were looking for an excuse to tell me it was all in my head. I also stutter badly when I’m anxious, and she looked me up and down and said “do you always stutter like this?” in the coldest voice. She prescribed some steroid pills, said “you’re fine” and walked away. It was such a horrible experience, and I don’t understand how people who are supposed to be so helpful can be so unkind.'],\n",

It sucked because I already figured that I have it due to all the symptoms that I had googled up. I was scared for the longest time that I would have fertility issues. And when people ask me if I'm gonna have a kid any time soon, it kills me because I tell them that my husband and I are trying. And then after a while, I'd tell them that I think I may have problems conceiving (this was before I was sure that I had PCOS). They would tell me that I'm not alone and that this person and that person has problems too. And I always know that they mean well and they're not trying to make me feel alone. But I still feel so alone because these people don't know my pain. But to watch your video today and hear you talk about it briefly, makes me feel so much better knowing that you're talking to me like I'm your friend and that you understand my pain.

As a part of recovering, I have chosen not to know my weight. It’s a huge trigger for me. \\nI was diagnosed with a desperate medical issue called Psuedotumor Cerebri and I went to a doctor for it. This doctor already knew I was recovering from anorexia. I weighed 115 pounds at this point in my life. And my doctor was like, “well, I think the pseudo tumor is your bodies way of telling you to lose weight. Once you lost 15-20 pounds this issue will go away.” \\nI was like THE FUCK? \\nAnd I mentioned that it was probably not healthy for me to do that because of my anorexia. \\nAnd he was like “welp, then you’ll have this problem forever. You really need to weigh yourself every few days and make sure you’re losing 15-20 pounds in the next month and a half.” \\nI walked out of that office and never went back. \\nNow I’m somewhere around 150 pounds and don’t have that issue anymore.

We had just started to try for a baby so this was devastating on top of the cancer diagnosis. My husband had his sample frozen so that we could possibly do ivf, which after his treatment was complete and he was in the clear we did pursue it. It is crazy expensive for sure. We definitely didn’t have the means to pay out of pocket for it and our insurance covered zero. We ended up getting a medical loan for it. It might not be ideal, but it is a route you could go if cost is one of the big reasons not to do it. Our clinic actually has a program that will allow you to pay a one time cost that will cover you up to 5 rounds of ivf and if at the end you don’t birth a live baby they will refund you in full. The cost for that was about two times the cost of one round. Pricey, but it gives you a little bit of a safety net so that if the first round doesn’t work that isn’t just a total lost cost. There are options if you research different clinics and what financial options they offer. In the end we have our son and are basically paying the equivalent of an average car payment for the fertility treatment. I know that ivf is hard physically and emotionally, but I just wanted to comment regarding the financial part since I know it’s pretty intimidating. Good luck to you!'],\n",

I\\'m sorry that you had to go through it with your doctor, especially since I\\'ve had those same appointments where you leave and just have to sob in your car afterwards. It can so easily throw you into a spiral that keeps you low for an entire week. What I can tell you that has helped me some is to remember that we put doctors on this pedestal of authority as a society but the fact of the matter is they are human. We give them so much power over our lives, our health, even our entire social policy but frankly some don\\'t deserve that power. Don\\'t forget that YOU are the patient and they work for YOU. If a doctor is ignoring your needs, try to leave (if other options are available) and leave comments about your experience to warn off other women. PCOS is incredibly common, 5-10% of women have it. We can do serious damage to a career or business if we all band together. If unable to leave, remember that when you are in that room, you have your own power and your own voice. If the doctor is circumventing what you want to talk about, interrupt them. Interrupt their power and say \"This isn\\'t what I\\'m here for. Your comments about x, ,y, z, are not needed.\"'],\n",

I have endometriosis and went through about 7 years of rude doctors, making me feel crazy, made me feel like a liar and so on. Finally I found a Facebook page that educated me more than i could ever find at doctors offices and I learned I could only be diagnosed through surgery as it’s rarely seen in imaging. The point of me sharing is to let you know you’re not alone in your frustration and it’s devastating but we have to be our own advocates because we cannot trust the medical professionals. And these diseases are more than a reproductive disease, they are a whole body disease as we feel other symptoms throughout the body and sometimes every day life is effected.

But I agreed to try alternatives because surgery was last resort and I thought I was out of options. Anyways, it took a failed attempt with pills and a horrible 6 months of pain with an IUD for my Gyno to finally agree to surgery. What caused the wonky periods? No clue. Never found an issue.

You\\'re so stupid to think that way.\" He just was like I don\\'t know why you\\'re here and we left. I left feeling so low and I\\'ve been scared to go to the doctor since. It really sucks that many older doctors don\\'t have enough updated training to handle sensitive situations like this. I\\'m sorry you had to go through this.'],\n",

Thank you so much for sharing because with health issues it is SO easy to feel isolated and alone because people don\\'t talk about it. Thanks for making me feel not alone. Winter is coming and I\\'m using my inhaler every day to keep my lungs clear to try to avoid pneumonia this year. Stay strong everyone'],\n",

PAID to help us. and even if they cannot fix your issue right away or give you all the answers immediately, some can’t even manage to treat you like a human and person deserving of respect and actual concern. ugh. it kills me. i’m so sorry you had to experience that evil shitty excuse for a medical professional.'],\n",

       "  \"john oliver did a segment on this recently, but doctors tend to talk to women differently, and there's this conundrum of 'women have higher pain tolerance so this shouldn't be a big deal to you' and also 'women are weak so you're just complaining'. doctors are trained to think about the male body as the norm, and i think more often than not, women have awful experiences at the doctor. i was born with an autoimmune disease and live at doctor's offices, but if i have to go see a specialist outside of my own group of doctors that i know and love, i'm terrified and i normally end up crying the day before just out of sheer fear of the way that doctors look at me and talk to me because i look younger than i am and i'm heavily tattooed and i'm a woman. it sucks and it's so unfair. it makes me not want to stay on top of taking care of myself even though i know that i can literally die if i don't. i hate hearing that it's happening to other women, but it's true. women are less likely to be diagnosed with serious illness in a timely fashion than men because doctors are dismissive of women, and something has to change.\"],\n",

My fabulous dermatologist moved (I have psoriasis), my great ophthalmologist retired and I went through 3 before I found one I could stand, my internal medicine doctor (diabetes) moved into another group practice where it takes 3-4 months to get an appointment with him, I quit my last internal medicine doctor because he was an arrogant butt, the one before that because she never looked you in the eyes the whole appointment (kept her head down writing in your chart and mumbling questions).  I got a referral to a rheumatologist because I had joint problems which could have been from the psoriasis or something else and had to wait 5 months for the first appointment, after which she sent me for tests and I didn't see her again for another 3 months.  Then she flatly tells me I have rheumatoid arthritis with no empathy or support whatsoever.  Made me feel like a whiner.  All my appointments with her are 5 minutes and out the door (next!).  I hate my doctors but I have to see them.  PCOS symptoms sound very familiar to me - I'm over 65 now so that's all behind me - but 45-50 years ago no one talked about PCOS (did they know?) and I think nowadays I would have been diagnosed with the condition.

I’m not the type to feel “pressure to buy” new shit because of the CONSTANT flow of new shit. So, that’s not why tons of reviews bother me. It’s because, first off, I’m not buying all the new shit. So, reviews on all the new shit aren’t beneficial for me. But, I mainly turn to my fav beauty YouTubers for inspiration, new looks, new ways I can use what I have, what I can create with what I already have, learning new techniques & over all improving my makeup skills. I can’t get enough tutorials. \\n& maybe I’m the only one but, I really don’t get why it’s even a thing to name videos “GRWM” vs “Tutorials”. I really don’t see the big difference. Most of the “GRWM”s, will still name what products &, maybe explain a little less, but for the most part it not so different lol. Again, maybe it’s just me. I like em both I guess.\\nPretty much, I like anything better than reviews & first impressions. I’d rather see less of those & more of the others. Basically I think the typical “ratio” of videos, should be flipped in my eyes. More GRWM & tuts. Less reviews. Unless you’re Taylor lol & it’s her Foundation Friday. But that’s very specific to foundation. Because everyone’s skin type is so different & want different finishes, coverages & formulas. An eyeshadow palette is an eyeshadow palette. A highlighter is a highlighter. Oh & why the hell are there so many! Jesus. Lol anyway gonna continue watching'],\n",

When you have a cycle it is debilitating.They are not anywhere near normal. I was told I would never have a baby. My doctor told me to shock my body into working right. So I went on a whole body cleanse and got a personal trainer and went to the gym 5 days a week for 3 weeks. I lost almost 20lbs. At that point I gave up on having a baby. We went out for New Year's Eve and I got wasted in which I'm not a drinker. That night I concived my now 11 year old. After my son was born within months the PCOS was back. Well, I decided to have Gastric Bypass and and after losing 60 lbs my body started working again and I had my next suprize baby. I'm now 10 years out of surgery and I lost a total of 170 lbs. Please don't take this the wrong way.  My point is there's hope! I love you and think you're amazing! Thank you for sharing and how real you are!\"],\n",

       "  \"My husband and I have gone through very similar issues. I was diagnosed with Endometriosis and we tried for 10 years to get pregnant, we did the same treatments too all except IVF, which we can't afford because in California it's 20 grand. First of all, who has that kind of money?! I had moved away from the Drs that I freaking loved and moved to California the land where Drs don't give 2 F's about you and who you are. So I've been searching for new Drs because I'm so sick of being treated like a name on a page and that's it. Yes, I know I have endometriosis, yes I know the symptoms and issues that come along with that, yes I have had surgeries and treatments and meds. Why do we have to rehash it every time we go see a Dr. Maybe if you took the time to look at my chart you'd know all this so I wouldn't have to relive it every time I come in. I pretty much gave up the idea of ever being a mom and I also was n a great place in my life until someone makes a big deal about why we don't have kids, or I have a bad Drs appointment and it brings it all up again. It's the worst feeling ever and I 100% know what you're feeling and going through. These issues aren't talked about enough and they need to be. So many women deal with infertility and are afraid to share because they've bene made to feel ashamed for an issue that is completely out of our control. We really need to change the dialogue when it comes to this. And if people get offended by you sharing your journey that's on them, it has nothing to do with you. I'm so proud of you for being so open and vulnerable and for not giving a F*ck. Standing strong with you and all the other women who are suffering along  with us. XOXO\"],\n",

       "  'I was treated like absolute GARBAGE by an ultrasound technician a few months ago. My hospital offers what they call “sneak peek” ultrasounds that you can get throughout your pregnancy that basically is just for pictures to send family and for yourself and what not and they don’t do any measurements or give you any information on how the baby is developing at all, which I was completely aware of at the time. My first ultrasound was at 20 weeks (which is the only ultrasound I could get that my insurance would pay for to check development and determine the sex) and the first technician I had was an angel. She was so sweet and was so genuinely excited for us and it was just an all around decent experience. The only thing that was concerning to me was her telling me that our baby was only in the 3rd percentile for weight/size for being 5 months pregnant. So I had that weighing on my mind all the time! I was scheduled another 9 weeks later for one of these sneak peek ultrasounds and I was excited but at the same time really bummed because I knew I wouldn’t find out anything about what was really concerning me and I was having a harder time with just being able to enjoy it. Two more months come around and I’m laying in the room with my boyfriend and the technician comes in and it’s a new lady that I’ve never met before. She seems ok at first, slightly smiling and introduces herself and gets the machine set up and gets me prepped for the pictures. As she’s looking around and taking photos she’s completely stone faced and says nothing and when I ask her what she’s taking photos of she gives me one word answers, the only considerate thing she did was make sure we knew the gender before taking pictures of the genital area or saying something to us if we were planning on it being a surprise. She then asks me if this is my second ultrasound, which if she would have taken the time to read my chart she would have been aware of my entire situation. I said yes and how we went in for our 20 week a couple of months ago and I mentioned the whole “3rd percentile” thing to her just in general basic conversation as I thought we were like filling her in since she seemed unaware of what exactly she was doing there or something.. she then in the RUDEST tone I’ve ever been spoken to says “well that’s not why we’re here today, it’s just to take pictures so let’s not try to get me to do more than my job entails today, ok?”... uh, wtf, where did that come from?!..And I just clarified that I was only just saying it was a bit of a bummer we can only have sneak peeks when we know her size is an issue and she then takes her last photo and clicks the machine off, violently scrapes the jelly off my stomach and says “well... it is what it is, life isn’t fair sometimes”. My boyfriend and I make eye contact and both have like “what the fuck” looks on our face but since it is a small town hospital where we have a lot of people that work there that we see on a daily basis, we didn’t want to cause a scene and get upset. She practically throws the pictures at me says “congrats and good luck with that” and wheels the machine out of the room. I could not believe that someone who works at a hospital would speak to a patient like that. Bad day or not! I wasn’t trying to pry her for information at all or get her to do any secret measurements for my peace of mind and she made it seem like I was this horrible, entitled person for just simply expressing our concerns from our first appointment.. not an experience you expect going in for an ultrasound and if I ever have any more kids I will make sure she is not my technician ever again. No one should ever walk out of a hospital/clinic feeling like they’re not but shit on someone’s shoe. I’m sorry you had to go through that, Kristi! Hopefully you can find someone who values you and your concerns!'],\n",

Excuse me? I think she thought that we were not trying to get pregnant or I was young meanwhile I was about 23/24. So not very young considering the age some kids are getting pregnant . Anyways yeah it broke my heart I will never forget that I cried for days I just I kind of knew I was miscarrying so that wasn’t the surprise to me the surprise is that how it was treated and the two seconds that she took out of her day to walk in on my room to tell me that and then I was to leave the room and just go home I was given no sorrow no nothing like they just thought I didn’t want to be pregnant I guess. anyways thank God I have been blessed with three kids this day and age but for people with PCOS or infertility issues or anything I feel for you I have nothing but support for anybody who wants to do anything to follow up whether that is IVF or adoption or if you just do not have kids.\\nKids are not for every couple.

It may not seem relevant but if I were you I would ABSOLUTELY reach out to that doctors practice manager and file a complaint. There may be other patients who had the problem too and if no one knows about it they cant fix it. Also I cant believe a practice would make you wait 6 months for a follow up appointment. If results were normal they should have called you to notify you and then if you still wanted the follow up to discuss further questions that's ok. I work in the medical field and I have seen staff and doctors treat people that way and it's simply disgusting. You never know what's going on in someone's life and a little compassion and understanding goes a long way. Again I'm so sorry that you had that horrible experience and I hope you can shake his words off and move past that experience. You are awesome!!!!!!!\"],\n",

I\\'ve had MANY a doctor tell me what was the point of figuring out my issues if I didn\\'t want to get pregnant, and that they wouldn\\'t do any testing or anything until I wanted to get pregnant.  Many doctors basically \"treated\" my issues with birth control pills.  Um hello, I want to know WHY my body is acting the way it is acting and what can I do to correct the problems! Finally, when I actually did want to get pregnant, I had to go through the ringer with all the tests, the doctors, the fertility clinic to get a \"diagnosis\" of Unexplained infertility, and did the Clomid which didnt work, and then injectables that finally did work for me.    But guess what, all my same issues returned afterwards and I still don\\'t know what\\'s wrong with me and never will.  Doctors can be so rude.  Not everything is about having babies, sometimes we want to know why our bodies are doing what they are doing, and how can we feel better.   I\\'m sorry you had to go through that.  Despite the fact the internet can be a negative place, there are still some positive places on the internet, and I joined an online community to help me through those hard times all filled with people who were in the same boat as me.
